# Future Scope

- Inclusion of Organizations as Users

One of the primary directions for expanding our application's capabilities involves integrating organizations as active users. This enhancement will empower various establishments to directly contribute to our database by adding their own information, particularly in terms of the disability accommodations they offer. By doing so, organizations can significantly enhance their visibility within the community, demonstrating their commitment to inclusivity and accessibility.

- Administrative Roles for In-App Management

Administrators, designated from within the user community or partner organizations, will be empowered to manage the exhaustive list of accommodations. They will have the capability to update, add, or remove entries as needed, ensuring the database remains current and relevant. This approach not only streamlines the process of keeping the database updated but also opens up opportunities for the database to grow organically, driven by community input and real-time needs.
